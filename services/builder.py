    FRAMEWORK GUIDE:
    The following framework titled "{framework_name}" provides key dimensions to consider when drafting the policy. These are NOT the content of the policy but should guide structure, scope, or alignment:

    {guidance_list}

    TASK:
    - Draft a policy that achieves the user's intent while addressing relevant framework dimensions where appropriate.
    - Include a title, introduction, 3â€“6 main sections (can align with or merge framework dimensions), and a conclusion.
    - Each section should tie back to the user goal but reflect awareness of the framework variables.
    - If a dimension is irrelevant to the user's input, skip it.
