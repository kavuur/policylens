# PolicyLensAI ‚Äî Intelligent Policy Analysis Platform

PolicyLensAI is an AI-enabled web application that helps policy researchers analyze, compare, and improve policy documents. It integrates document processing, evidence retrieval, and large-language-model (LLM) analysis into an interactive research workflow. Built with modern RAG services, the app supports structured policy review, automated excerpt extraction, and live drafting assistance.

### üß≠ Core Features

* **Policy Upload & Extraction**
  Upload policy PDFs or Word files. The system automatically extracts text and structures it into analyzable sections.

* **AI-Driven Analysis**
  Uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o model to identify key policy excerpts, align them to codebook frameworks, and generate improvement recommendations.

* **Evidence Integration**
  Automatically derives keywords and queries Google Custom Search to retrieve academic and grey literature supporting or challenging policy content.

* **Framework Comparison**
  Annotates aligned and misaligned policy segments, highlighting excerpts directly in the rendered PDF, with hover-based pop-up explanations.

* **Interactive Research Tools**
  Create and edit projects, codebooks, codes, subcodes, and excerpts. Collaborate with other users, manage media files, and view structured comparisons.

* **Live Writing Assistant**
  A ‚ÄúLive Writing‚Äù mode suggests evidence-based sentences and structures in real time while drafting policy briefs, frameworks, or strategic plans.

* **Data Management**
  Includes migration and schema scripts for updating database structures, sample data generation utilities, and dummy excerpt populators.
